# RT Back2Life

**RT Back2Life** is an AI-driven video chatbot that aims to replicate a person’s personality and appearance, offering a personalized and interactive experience. Powered by advanced deep learning technologies, the system uses TensorFlow generative models for image, audio, and text synthesis, integrated seamlessly into a Unity-based environment.

## Features

- **Realistic Avatar**: Generates a 3D avatar that mirrors a person’s appearance.
- **Personality Replication**: Uses NLP and deep learning models to simulate personality, behavior, and conversational style.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Enables live video chat with a virtual representation of the person.
- **AI-Generated Voice**: Real-time synthesis of voice matching the person’s speech patterns.
- **Multi-Modal Inputs**: Combines visual, textual, and audio models for an immersive experience.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up **RT Back2Life** on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Delgado1969/RT-Back2Life.git
```
2.	Install Unity:
   
	•	Download and install Unity Hub from the official site.
	•	Create a new Unity project with the correct version that matches the project requirements (refer to Unity version in the README or the ProjectSettings folder).

4.	Install TensorFlow:
   
To use the AI models, install TensorFlow by running the following:
```bash
   pip install tensorflow
```
4. **Install Dependencies**:

In the project folder, install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5.	Setup the Unity Environment:

 •	Open Unity and load the RT_Back2Life project.

 •	Ensure all Unity packages and assets are properly imported.

6.	Run the Project:

In Unity, click Play to start the simulation of the AI-driven video chatbot.

## Usage

1.	Running the AI Video Chatbot:
	
  •	Open the MainScene in Unity.
	
  •	Press Play to start the interaction. The avatar will appear on screen, ready for conversation.
	
  •	Type or speak to the chatbot, and the system will respond based on the person’s characteristics.
	
 2.	Customizing Your Model:
	
  •	To customize the appearance or personality, modify the input models or use custom training datasets.
	
  •	You can replace avatar textures, voice synthesis, or personality algorithms by updating the corresponding assets and models in the Unity environment and TensorFlow integration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
	
 •	Unity (latest stable version or specific version mentioned in the project).
	
 •	Python 3.x with TensorFlow.
	
 •	CUDA (for GPU acceleration, optional but recommended for faster processing).

## Technologies

 •	Unity: For real-time 3D rendering and interaction.
	
 •	TensorFlow: For AI and machine learning models handling image, audio, and text generation.
	
 •	Python: For AI model training, data processing, and integration with Unity.
	
 •	C#: Used within Unity to handle interactions and logic.
	
 •	OpenCV (optional): For advanced image processing.

## Architecture

1. Unity Frontend:
   
	
  •	Manages the interactive user interface (UI).
	
  •	Handles real-time rendering of the avatar and interface components.

  •	Responsible for sending and receiving data from AI models.

3. AI Backend:
	
  •	Image Generation: Uses TensorFlow models for generating and animating the avatar based on the user’s inputs.
	
  •	Audio Synthesis: The voice is generated based on an individual’s voice model and response data.
	
  •	Text Generation: Textual responses are generated using NLP models like GPT-3 or other pre-trained language models.

4. Communication:

  •	WebSockets: For real-time communication between Unity and Python server running TensorFlow models.
	
  •	REST APIs: Can be implemented for more structured data requests if needed.
